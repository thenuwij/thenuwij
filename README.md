## Hi there 👋

I’m Thenuja, a final-year Computer Engineering (Honours) student at UNSW Sydney with a strong interest in backend, systems, and AI-driven software. I enjoy building reliable, scalable systems and working close to the fundamentals of how software and hardware interact.

I’m currently completing my Honours thesis, where I built UniVise, a full-stack AI platform that helps students plan courses, majors, and career pathways. Through this project, I worked across the stack using Python, PostgreSQL, and React, with a focus on backend logic, data handling, and designing systems that can support real users and evolving requirements.

Alongside this, I’ve worked on systems-focused projects such as a real-time FPGA audio pipeline using VHDL, AXI DMA, and embedded C, which strengthened my understanding of performance constraints, low-latency data flow, and hardware–software integration.

Outside of tech, I enjoy cycling and occasionally running to stay active and clear-headed. I’m always keen to learn, collaborate, and work on meaningful products, and I’m currently seeking software engineering internship opportunities where I can grow while contributing to real-world systems.
Let’s connect.
